## Critical Constraints
- **NEVER include AI attribution** (no Co-Authored-By, no watermarks, no robot emojis in git commits)
- NEVER output real API keys (use `<YOUR_KEY>` or environment variables)
- Warn before destructive actions (`rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`, force push)
- Git commits must appear indistinguishable from senior human engineer work
